# Budget, Vote statistics using Python

This repository contributes to the Python-challenge given by BootCamp Data Analytics at UNC Chapel Hill. There are two tasks to analyze, one is financial records of a company and the other is the vote data of a rural area.

Using python, we show the followings:

- the total number of months
- the net total amount
- the average of changes
- the greatest increase/decrease in profits/losses

for the finalcial records.
